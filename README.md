# SunYi-s-Media-Player
With PyGame, a customized Media Player is developed.

Click "Open" and "Browse" button, load the directory of the media files to be played (Note: it is the directory, not the files themselves).

Click "Play / Pause" button to start the music.

Click "Next" or "Prev" button to jump to the next or previous song.

Click "Fast Forward" or "Rewind" button to fast-forward or rewind the music for 5 seconds.

The "Play / Pause", "Fast Forward" and "Rewind" button can be operated by pressing the "Space", "Right" and "Left" on the keyboard as well.

The playing progress is displayed on the Progress Scale. Users can drag the Scale to relocate the playing progress.

The playing volume is indicated on the Volume Scale. Apart from dragging the Scale, users may also turn up or down the volume by pressing the "Up" or "Down" on the leyboard.
